      <description>#Introduction *This project analyzes portions of three datasets that provide information on all of the 50 US states, excluding the District of Columbia. Each datset provides either information on crime, car crashes, or population statistics in each state. I chose these datasets because I wanted to see if there was a connection between state statistics (income, illiteracy, etc), reckless driving, and/or crime. I expected that with more poverty, less education, and higher urban populations I would find more crime and reckless driving.</description>
