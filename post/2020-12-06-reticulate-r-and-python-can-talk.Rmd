Reticulate is a great package because it lets you use code across R and python. In essence, it is how R and Python talk! Here are a few examples of how reticulate works:

```{R}
library(reticulate)
grades<-data.frame(Points=c(99,76,87,95,50),Letter=c("A","C","B","A","F"))
head(grades)
```

```{python}
import numpy as np
avg=np.mean(r.grades.Points)
if avg>90:
  print("Your average is an A")
elif avg>80:
  print("Your average is a B")
elif avg>70:
  print("Your average is a C")
else:
  print("Your average is a F")
```
